How to install RELACS:

You need:
- Linux
- make
- g++  (gnu C++ compiler)
- dl library (/usr/lib/libdl.so)
- Qt library version 3.3
- optional the GSL library (GNU scientific library)
- doxygen


1. unpack the tgz file :-)

> tar xzvf relacs-xxx.tgz


2. Compile it by executing

> make all

In case this it not working:
- Make shure you have the Qt libraries and include files 
  installed (version 3.3)
- Check wether the environment variable QTDIR is
  set to the right path: env | grep QTDIR
  If not then set the QTPATH variable in Makefile.h to
  the appropriate path
If it is still not working wait for the first official release!


3. Create the documentation

> make doc

You need doxygen to be able to generate the documentation.


4. Create the help files for the plugins

> make help

This also requires doxygen.


5. Read the relacs web pages in

doc/web/index.html

and the documentation in

doc/html/index.html

with your favorite web browser / html viewer.


6. Start RELACS in simulation mode by calling

> relacs -3


7. If you want to use RELACS for acquiring data 
(that's what you want!) you need to install the driver
for the data acquisition board.

Note: This prerelease still does not fully support 
the comedi drivers and does not contain any other driver.
Wait for the first official release!

8. Setting up device access
For accessing devices through the parallel or serial ports you need
to ensure that the appropriate modules are loaded and that
the corresponding device files have the appropriate permissions set.

For debian linux with an 2.6.18 linux kernel (as for January 2008) I
need to do the following:

- add "ppdev" to the file /etc/modules to have parallel port support
  loaded into the kernel and to get the /dev/parport0 device file.
- add "lp" and "dialout" as groups to the file /etc/security/group.conf
  to make the current user a member of the lp and dialout groups and
  thus allow him to use the parallel port (/dev/parport0) and the serial port
  (/dev/ttyS0). This is the crucial line in group.conf:
  *; *          ; *; Al0000-2400; cdrom,floppy,plugdev,fuse,dialout,lp
- after restarting the computer and logging in you should be member of 
  the lp and dialout groups (execute the "groups" command in a shell)
  and both the /dev/parport0 and /dev/ttyS0 device files should be
  present, their permissions set to 'rw' for the group members, and their 
  groups should be lp and dialout, respectively 
  (check with ls -l /dev/parport0).

9. Start RELACS in acquisition mode by calling

> relacs

Enjoy!

how to use ChangeLog from Emacs
(from http://autotoolset.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html#SEC24):

To use Dired effectively, we recommend that you add the following customizations to your `.emacs' file: First, add

(add-hook 'dired-load-hook (function (lambda () (load "dired-x"))))
(setq dired-omit-files-p t)

to activate the extended features of Dired. Then add the following key-bindings to the global keymap:

(global-set-key [f8] 'add-change-log-entry-other-window)

New InData threading:
- How to set restart time in all data traces (see filterdetectors)?
- How to propagate a new recording event from SaveFiles back to the raw data (SaveFiles::openFiles)?
- What about recording events (SignalTime, locking)?
- Add Model data also to UpdateRawData?
- Fix Simulation mode!
- Simplify and unify the diverse RePro::sleep() functions. Add a waitOnSignal() ?
- Check locking of SaveFiles data
- Model: improve locking by adding an extra Mutex for push() and pop()
- Check InData::mode() usage, in particular AdjustField in FilterDetectors
- Filter buffersize should just be the same as the one of the input trace!
- Replace the source() flag by a sourceTrace and sourceEvent index
  Remove the source mapping functions from RELACSPlugin and FilterDetectors
- AnalogInput/Output check usage of IsPrepared and IsRunning
- DynClamAnalogInput improve error checking in readData()
- readData() several attemps only if maxn is too small
- Once the Devices inherit options, AnalogOutput::setDelay() should set the corresponding option.
- Rethink activateGains(): DynClamp can handle this without restarting and 
  by passing a flag through the FIFO.
- SpectrumAnalyzer Frequency resolution should not depend on sampling rate!
  Use Frequency resolution instead of number of fft points.
- Check whether InData, Acquire updateTime and readTime are still needed!
  But we do not want to block on the input too long!
  So maybe keep readTime. Make it an option for each device!
- SaveFiles: where does stimulus intensity go, if there is no amplifier?
  (e.g. patchclamp::MembraneResistance)
- SaveFiles: RePros without stimuli should get their start into stimuli.dat
- SaveFiles: recording-events.dat: is that absolute time, or does this reflect pauses in recordings?

Options:
- RePro: when the RePo changes an Option in main(), this change should automatically be made permanent
  (via setToDefaults() called after main()? E.g. SetInputGain RePro).
- Make all Options and optWidget style flags an enum
- ConfigDialog: name should be the Options::name! Maybe already in ConfigClass?
- OutData: rename Ident to name OR remove it?
- DeviceList and FilterDetectors (and others?) should use plugin name (ident) as section name.
- Improve SaveFiles: no hand coded saving of sections, all should be done with saveXML()!
- check config files (in particular empty comments, units in lists [a, b, ckHz], etc!)
- are uniqueNames also used for relacsplugins.cfg ?
- Device menu should be hierarchically using section structure of device infos.
- operator[] and section() should only return Parameter/Options from this Options
  BUT: auditory::session::notifyMetaData!
- Check and update how plugins save data and use settings() and stimulusData()

patchclamp::SingleStimulus:
- Add zero to noise stimuli (all stimuli?)
- Check offset settings, are they relative to the previous last output value???

auditory::Session plots do not work! Why???? It works on my laptop!

OptWidget:
  updateValues called from notify from valueChanged does nothing, since DisableUpdate is set!
  This is a problem for all filters and detectors!

General:
- comedi m4 file should check for routing function
- relacshelp should know whether doxygen is there, or whether the files it is operating on, exist.
- add a README file to share/relacs/configs/
- make the config files more generic (lab address!)
- check device config files
- check all config files
- update m4 files: relacs_sndfile is most up to date

Robot:
- Remove RELACS_COND_TML from plugins/base/src/Makefile.am once the necessary functionality has been moved back to Manipulator

Acquire:
- check write( OutList ) functions. They should throw an error if sigs.size() == 0!
- levels(), minLevel() and other Attenuate properties should all go
  into Attenuate in case of NoAttenuator!
- How to make sure the right Attenuate is used for a given RePro?

Metadata support of OutData:
- The following RePros still need to be updated for an appropriate OutData::description:
  auditory: adaptedficurve, syslatency
  auditoryprojects: spikeprecision
  efield: jar
  efish: chirps, ficurve, sam
  patchclamp: simple
  patchclampprojects: thresholdlatencies, feedforwardnetwork
- Remove OutData::ident()
- Check loading of metadata descriptions from stimulus files in OutData::load(),
  check usage in auditory::singlestimulus, efield::jar, etc.
- Implement oprators =, +, etc. for OutData such that they take descriptions into account!
  (i.e. in isoresponse, spikeprecision, efish::filestimulus, patchclamp::singlestimulus, OutData::maximize())
- Remove most of the OutData constructors that resize the data? You should use *Wave() instead!
- How should setIntensity() interact with amplitudes and intensities in signal descriptions?
- Where does setIntensity() get its unit from for descriptions?
- Check usages of some "header" information in
  auditory::singlestimulus, auditoryprojects::spikeprecision.cc, patchclamp::singlestimulus, etc.
- Can OutDataInfo, which is only used in SaveFiles, be replaced by Options or OutData/OutList with a copy function that only copies members but no data?
- Check how OutList.description() can be used in SaveFiles
- Check whether OutData/List.desription() can be filled up in SaveFiles
  and then passed to DataIndex - YES!
- ThresholdLatencies: check stimulus descriptions
- There should be a flag for Parameter in OutData::description()
  indicating, which quantities to extract in SaveFiles
- OutData::append() needs to update timing information!
- Add ramp and appendRamp functions to OutData that set also the descriptions
- Update odML terminologies accordingly.
- Stimulus section needs a file (if available)!
- sineWave() can be stimulus or carrier with const AM. How to deal with that?
  Even worse: what is that two-frequency stimulus in isoresponse?
- SaveFiles: finish reorganization of saveStimuli(): check XXX comments

Locking:
- DeviceList functions like updateData need to be locked!
- RELACSWidget:: write() should unlock InData!?!
- dead locks: do we need to take care about blocking lockMutex() in accept(), reset(), etc.?

Macros:
- check online message command and a following RePro (will be part of the message!)
- Remove quotes from message
- delete all MacroCommands after usage!
- The menu of a MacroCommand should have the options of the called Macro with
  overwritten Options colored blue (same as for the repros).
- The menu of a MacroCommand should display overwritten values.
- add stopSession macro command
- add new macro command to set all sorts of internal Options (e.g. stimulusData!)
- add dialog macro command for launching macro and repro dialogs, meta data dialog, etc.
- Macro Options and Macro stack (B R N keys) do not work together
- Add possibility to call shell command that returns a command line,
   e.g. RePro call, for the Macros
- Possibility to quit a macro after  the current RePro finished normally
  (similar to break, but without softStopRequest).

Numerics:
- Problems with the pow function (in containerfuncs.h): bug in xarray.cc
- LinearRange: check overflow in NSize due to too small stepsize in
   constructors and resize, etc. and throw a warning (this happens
   in EventData when working with microseconds spikes and the default
   stepsize)
- Check EventData, how we could avoid this problem
- EventList should not bee a vector!

Plugin documentation:
- Each publication should get a file indicating the RePros it used:
  - list for each publication the used RePros
  - show in the plugin summaries for each RePro the number of publications
  - add a section to each RePro linking to its publications
- Need to document the comedi and dynclamp plugins!
- Option for automatic screenshot at the end of stimulus (in menu)

Plot:
- possibly infinite loop in line 1527 (autoscaling) from line 1534 (initTics)
  because of YMin or YMax isnan: probably fixed...
- change zoom behavior on axis (centered)
- make the zoom stack optional - remember only the default range or a maximum number of stack frames
- add min/maxZoomRanges to optionally restrict zooming
- Plot::DataElement should have a MapD from which the plot is drawn using *double pointers,
  CopyData should copy the data within the plot() functions to this buffer,
  KeepData should do this within the draw() function
- Plot::draw() should do all the initialization and only defer the plotting itself.
- check alignment of grid with plotted lines at various plot widget sizes!

Analog Input/Output:
- Docu regarding hard calibrate is probably wrong! Read man comedi_calibrate.
- Replace Ident by Name in InData, OutData, TraceSpec
- WriteDataThread should not be started if the whole stimulus is already transfered.
- check and improve writeReset and writeZero interfaces and implementations.
- directWrite implementation should take care about synchronization as well!
  ComediAnalogOutput should use instruction lists for this.
- Add error messages string to all devices that can be set especially from the open() call.
- Comedi autotools check: old comedi versions do not have the setrouting function

Dynamic clamp:
- Is it smart to use vmalloc in dynclampmodule? No! Better would be
  kmalloc or even avoid it completely.
- Is it really necessary that the dyncclamp parameter are all set to zero by relacs initially?
  It shoud be sufficient to set the AOs to zero and the parameters to their initial vallues.
  For the latter we might need some support (saving the initial values to some array prior to starting, etc.)
- Add a varable lastInterval that is set to the current period length in addition to loopInterval
- CHECK IT! Both kernel modules, optional trigger, and DynClampAnalogOutput
- include of asm-offsets.h in src/Makefile.am could be made part of a
   linux kernel source detection macro.
- write back real time loop frequency to InList and OutList samplerate.
- rewrite analog input part of the dynamic clamp loop in dynclampmodul
  similar to the analog output part
- shouldn't it be better if the model would get the parameter first,
  then computes, and then analog output takes place?

Save files:
- check on hardware and with short stimuli!
- check saveToggle, i.e. event times and stimuli indices!

Thread safety:
- make sure that any QWidget does not raise, lower, close, update, repaint, erase, 
  (i.e. calls a function that triggers an Qt event) outside the GUI thread!
  - show & hide: in Macros::loadMacros(), in RePros::raise(), in OptWidget::assign(),
    OptDialog::exec(), in auditory::Session
- make sure that all RePro, Macro, and Session starting and stopping is
  done from the GUI thread only!
- disentangle start and stopSession calls?
- OptWidget::assign is not thread safe

Acquisition interface:
- check whether test, prepare, and start can be used simulataneously with read/write
- add single data read and write

Plugins:
- Add a dependency virtual function, that can be used to query all the plugins
  (and traces?) this plugin depends on. 
  - Autoload missing control plugins?
  - Add return values to a doxygen section of the docu.
- Put relacs configuration files in root directory of ALL the plugin sets

Relacs:
- Check and clean up RELACSPlugin and RePro public/protected/private functions.
- Parameter/Options/OptWidget: generalize selectText() and index() to all types
- Fix command line arg names from path to dir in relacsmain and RELACSWidget.
- Use QLibrary instead of dlopen for loading plugins.
- Reading config from PWD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH containing PWD
  -> On/off by user?
- Log files written to relacs exec dir, not /var/log?
  - Set log location in <relacslocal>/<src/relacs>
    use @...@ for this (prefix?)

Documentation:
- Update relacshelp and createweb for different versions of doxygen
  (it works on my laptop but not on the PC - version 1.7.4)
- check relacshelp.mk and the help line in doxygen.mk for abs_build_dir!
- Update doxygen dot settings
- Update Makefile instructions to autotools
- You may want to use: ./configure --htmldir=DOCDIR/html
- Static libraries are disabled by default, enable with --enable-static
- Mention that all m4/ , *.mk , and Doxyfile files are identical and should remain so
- Hint to 
  Integrating Qt's Meta object compiler (moc) with GNU Automake
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=133
  and
  The Autotools file jungle (== version 3)
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=131
- when changing the interface of the libraries 
  make sure that nothing is installed in prefix/lib!
  For finalizing a change in the interface the version number of the library
  needs to be changed.
- For developing: make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not contain pathes to any relacs libraries,
  best is to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""
- Add brief documentation to the examples! (a README file)

Libraries:
- Add relacs library tests to the libraries!
- AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE( gnits )
- autoreconf:
  * configure.ac.in AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])
  * Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4

Autotools:
- Make datatools a separate project
- Check m4 macro style
- Check for C++ requirements (STL, templates)
- Math library check: LT_LIB_M
- moc3.mk: clean-am should be clean-local, but this is not called from Makefile!
  However, why is this clean-am not overriding the original clean-am?
- We need GNU make for the moc rules. And therefore test for GNU make.
  However, can't we use from automake "18.2 Handling new file extensions"
  something like:
  SUFFIXES = .h .moc.cc
  .h.moc.cc :
	$(MOC) -i -o "$@" "$<"
  However, the header files are not in the same directory!
- Add rand55 test and make sure that the dox file PREDEFINED variable gets HAVE_LIBRAND55 define set
  http://summa.physik.hu-berlin.de/~beule/random/random55.tar.gz
- upgrade to Automake 1.10.1 and add LZMA support, remove .zip archives
- uninstall: also remove relacs subdirectories?!
- make distcheck: 
  release.sh /home/jan/prj/relacs/relacsinstall

Distribution details:
- Look through and clean up utils/ folder
  update & install: bin2wav (--help and --version)
  update & install: uw2sw
  update & dist: remotebackup
  update & install: scaninf scaninf.doc
  update: stopjobs
  update: updatefiles
  help: svn-*



---------------------------------

Adjust input range:
  - outsource this in a control widget or to the PlotTrace widget.
  - Search/FIField: slower change of input range!
    * option: increase range only
    * decrease range after n stimuli only

SpikeDetector: 
  - Add plot showing the time evolution of the spike size.
  - Save this trace!

Devices:
  - Add and implement probe() and possibly requires() function
  - implement "dummy (DocDevice)" devices that only get infos from
    the config file and thus serve as documentation of all the used hardware.

OutData, Acquire:
 - handle unset SampleInterval

RELACS:
 - "labbook/protocol/log" options as a tab along with the session
   for recording manual manipulations of the experiment.
   Saved directly in the trigger.dat file and
   available to the RePros. 

A new Tab-Widget Container:
 - show tabs only if more than one tab
 - switch between tabs with shift-arrow left/right
 - minimizable
 - button menu on right click
 - use for detectors and sessions and repros
 - -> QDockWidgets !

Finding a P-Unit:
 - Phase-locked spike response?
   If not it might be a Pd feedback fiber (at 80-100Hz).
 - SAM: P-Unit fires only on rising face, 
   5Hz beat, 20% Contrast, 10 beat cycles.

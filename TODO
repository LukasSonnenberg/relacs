Libraries:
- introduce namespace 'relacs' to all libraries
- add libtool version to libraries:
  librelacs_la_LDFLAGS = -version-number major[:minor[:revision]]
- add relacs library tests to the libraries!
- no static libraries (at least for the plugins)! -> AC_ENABLE_SHARED, AC_DISABLE-STATIC

Plugins:
- there are unique plugin names (librelacsauditory...), unique help files
  (Auditory-...), but what about the header files of the plugins?
  -> <relacs/auditory/foo.h>
- names of relacs plugins without "librelacs" prefix? 
  pkglib_LTLIBRARIES = mymodule.la
  mymodule_la_LDFLAGS = -module
- The right name for dlopen can be found in the dlname filed of the *.la file!
  Use this approach for loading the plugins?

Both:
- include of local headers also with <relacs/foo.h>?
- check libdir in the libraries and plugins
- add RELACS_ to double include prevention

Autotools:
- when running debugger on libtool executable (like relacs_main?)
  you need to call
  libtool --mode=execute gdb relacs_main
  Update relacs script accordingly!
- Put relacs configuration files in demo subdirectory of the plugin sets?
- Math library check: LT_LIB_M
- Use LT_INIT intstead of AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
- AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE( [std-options] ) to check whether all programs and scripts 
  have --help and --version options
- AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE( [gnu] ) checks for GNU make ?
- moc3.mk: clean-am should be clean-local, but this is not called from Makefile!
  However, why is this clean-am not overriding the original clean-am?
- upgrade to Automake 1.10.1 and add LZMA support, remove .zip archives
- uninstall: also remove relacs subdirectories?!
- Use current version of doxygen for debian,
  update the Doxyfile or remove new/old settings
- make distcheck: 
  release.sh /home/jan/prj/relacsinstall --with-qt3=/usr/lib/qt3 --disable-doxygen-dot
- Add rand55 test and make sure that the dox file PREDEFINED variable gets HAVE_LIBRAND55 define set
  http://summa.physik.hu-berlin.de/~beule/random/random55.tar.gz
- Integrate examples (with extra target)  no-compile Makefiles???
- Log files written to relacs exec dir, not /var/log?
  - Set log location in <relacslocal>/<src/relacs>
    use @...@ for this (prefix?)
- Reading config from PWD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH containing PWD
  -> On/off by user?

Documentation:
- Update installation and Makefile instructions to autotools
- You may want to use: ./configure --htmldir=DOCDIR/html
- Mention that all m4/ , *.mk , and Doxyfile files are identical and should remain so
- Hint to 
  Integrating Qt's Meta object compiler (moc) with GNU Automake
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=133
  and
  The Autotools file jungle (== version 3)
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=131
- when changing the interface of the libraries 
  make sure that nothing is installed in prefix/lib!
  For finalizing a change in the interface the version number of the library
  needs to be changes.

Bug in MetaData Dialog: after opening and closing with ESC, reopening crashes the program

Bug somewhere: if session is running, start of repro kills RELACS
This always exits at savefiles.cc line 373: 
RelacsWidget::startRePro() ->
SaveFiles::write( RePro ) -> SaveFiles::writeStimulus() -> 
	    TriggerKey.save( *TF, StimulusToWrite[j].ident() );
-> cleanup savefiles! make sure that writing to files is locked!


Start implementing Dynclamp module!


new RePro name: ExPro, Protocol, ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 1.8.18 oel.cfg:
  - "extref" for AnalogOutput devices
  - new config section FilterDetectors in oel.cfg!
  - remove eventdetector.h eventdetector.cc, detectors.h detectors.cc,
    *dock*, make dependall
  - add to outputdata:
       outputtraceid: Left-Speaker|Right-Speaker
  outputtracechannel: 0|1
   outputtracedevice: ao-1|ao-1
  outputtracemaxrate: 240|240kHz
    outputtracedelay: 0|0ms
  - add devices:

*Analog Input Devices
  plugin1: DAQNIE|AISim
  device1: /dev/comedi0
   ident1: ai-1

*Analog Output Devices
  plugin1: DAQNIE|AOSim
  device1: /dev/comedi1
   ident1: ao-1

- in Attenuator Interfaces change "daq1: daq-1" to "ao1: ao-1"

Update 1.8.14:
  - make cleanall
  - daq/src: remove eventdata.* eventlist.* detector.h
  - numerics/src: remove basefuncs.h
  - oel.cfg: replace "daq1: 0" by "daq1: daq-1" in AttInterfaces
             remove "mode1" line in AttDevices
  - oelplugins.cfg: Auditory Neuron Model

---------------------------------

Macros, SpikeDetector, PlotTrace:
  - check font size on fourier

ConfigDialog:
  - generalize usage of icon in header!
  - generalize such that RePro's also can use the standard dialog.

RePros:
  - use convert( OutData& )!
  - check save() function of all RePros.
  - test all RePros! Especially the files they are saving.
  - Search/FIField: slower change of input range!
    * option: increase range only
    * decrease range after n stimuli only

SpikeDetector: 
  - Add plot showing the time evolution of the spike size.
  - Save this trace!

Macros:
  - Possibility to quit a macro after  the current RePro finished normally
    (similar to break, but without softStopRequest).

Devices:
  - Add and implement probe() and possibly requires() function
  - implement settings() (AnalogIn/Output, Attenuator, Attenuate already done)
  - implement "dummy (DocDevice)" devices that only get infos from
    the config file and thus serve as documentation of all the used hardware.

Attenuate:
  - a unit for intensity!
  - interaction with gain settings of daq board? Are there boards with
    many gains for analog output.

Session:
  - move sessionData() to FileSave (this is the only place where this is used?)
  - does a session really need to be an plugin? Could that not be just a Control
    that has the "Cell found" button? Check both Auditory and Efish-Session!
  - Both Control and RePro should have a sessionStart() and sessionStop() function
    (not init() and reset()).

ConfigDialog:
  - check recursive mutex

Need a ComediNIESeriesPFI and a ComediDIO device class.

Filter/Detectors/PlotTrace:
  Make PlotTrace better configurable!

Plugins:
 - access by index with index equal to index in container, not an id.
 - use Qt shared libraries interface!? 
   QWidgetPlugin would replace addPlugin and/or the Plugin class (?)
   and can contain whatever classes as plugins.
   What about Qt 4? Provides a new and much better interface!

OutData, Acquire:
 - handle unset SampleInterval

EventData, FileWrite:
 - units of size don't have to be the unit of the trace!

A virtual I/O Data handler controlling the data flow in RELACS.
 - online data aquisition
 - simulation
 - data browser
 - data analysis

RELACS:
 - "labbook/protocol/log" options as a tab along with the session
   for recording manual manipulations of the experiment.
   Saved directly in the trigger.dat file and
   available to the RePros. 
 - clear and reset all inputdata, eventdata and data acquisition 
   at session start and session end to avoid index and time overflows!
 - IOData, EventData, FileWrite, ...: new time zero reference handling!

A new Tab-Widget Container:
 - show tabs only if more than one tab
 - switch between tabs with shift-arrow left/right
 - minimizable
 - button menu on right click
 - check KDE for such a widget (KJanusWidget)
 - use for detectors and sessions and repros


---------------------------------

Finding a P-Unit:
 - Phase-locked spike response?
   If not it might be a Pd feedback fiber (at 80-100Hz).
 - SAM: P-Unit fires only on rising face, 
   5Hz beat, 20% Contrast, 10 beat cycles.

\brief Plugins for dynamic clamp based on RTAI and comedi.


Comedi (linux control and measurement device interface) provides hardware drivers
to many data acquisition boards with a common library interface.
The RELACS Comedi plugins access data acquisition boards by means of the Comedi library.

For general information about Comedi and a list of supported devices
see http://www.comedi.org

\section rtaicomediintro Introduction

For using dynamic clamp, i.e. some realtime computation, as it is
implemented by the DynClampAnalogInput and DynClampAnalogOutput
plugins, you need to install an RTAI-patched real-time linux
kernel, RTAI kernelmodules, and comedi, as described in the following
sections.


\section installrtaikernel  Linux kernel and RTAI patch

\subsection patchkernel Download RTAI, a linux kernel and patch the kernel

-# Login as root and cd into \c /usr/local/src:
\code
sudo su  # or su
cd /usr/local/src
\endcode
-# Download the latest RTAI (http://www.rtai.org) version into \c
/usr/local/src. Either from the official RTAI cvs repository
\code
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gna.org:/cvs/rtai co magma
ln -sf magma rtai
\endcode
or from Shahbaz Youssefi's rtai clone on github:
\code
git clone https://github.com/ShabbyX/RTAI.git
ln -sf RTAI rtai
\endcode
\note Read the rtai/README.INSTALL file!
-# Find out your CPU architecture:
\code
uname -m
\endcode
-# Check for available patches. Get a list of all patches for all architectures:
\code
find rtai/base/arch/ -name '*.patch' | sort
\endcode
The most recent patches for both intel and amd 32 and 64-bit systems (x86_64 and i386 architectures)
are in the \c x86/ directory.
Decide for a patch, and remember its version number: \c hal-linux-<kernel-version>-*.patch
-# Download a 'vanilla' kernel, e.g. \c linux-<kernel-version>.tar.xz from http://www.kernel.org
  to \c /usr/src and unpack the kernel:
\code
cd /usr/src
wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.8.13.tar.xz
tar xf linux-3.8.13.tar.xz
mv linux-3.8.13 linux-3.8.13-rtai
ln -sfv linux-3.8.13-rtai linux
cd linux
make mrproper
\endcode
\note For compiling the DynClamp plugin RELACS assumes that 
\c /usr/src/linux points to your rtai patched kernel!
So the softlink is important.
-# Patch the kernel (use the patch file that matches the downloaded kernel)
\code
$ cd /usr/src/linux
$ patch -p1 < /usr/local/src/rtai/base/arch/x86/patches/hal-linux-3.8.13-x86-4.patch
\endcode
-# Configure, compile, and install the kernel as described in the following section.


\subsection compilekernel Compile the rtai-patched linux kernel

-# make sure the \c make, \c gcc, \c libncurses-dev, and \c zlib1g-dev packages are installed:
\code
apt-get -y install make gcc libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev
\endcode
-# There are (at least) two strategies for getting a good real-time kernel. The somewhat simpler approach
that most likely gives a running kernel, but also might result in bad or not so good real-time performance
is described here. Alternatively, I highly recommend to consider the approach described in 
\c /usr/local/src/rtai/README.INSTALL . For this you need more time to set the right kernel options,
but the kernel will compile much faster.
-# So, be warned! Here is the beginners way to make a real-time kernel. Simply reuse your current kernel configuration:
\code
cd /usr/src/linux
cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
make oldconfig
\endcode
Hit \c enter to all the (probably many) questions.
-# Steps 5. to 8. describe the normal way to compile a linux kernel.
On Debian systems there is an elegant alternative that is described
in step 9. below.
-# First, you configure your kernel by calling
\code
make menuconfig
\endcode
In the kernel configuration dialog you should do the following settings:
  - General setup: set "Local version" to "-rtai" or make sure it is empty in case you are using \c make-kpkg
  - Enable loadable module support: 
    - Select "Enable module support"
    - Deselect "Module versioning support"
  - Processor type and features: 
    - Disable "Tickless System"
    - Select your "Subarchitecture Type" (PC-Compatible) - this option does not exist for newer kernels
    - Select the right Processor family (you find the name of your processor by looking at \c /proc/cpuinfo,
      check \c "help" to find out, which Processor family you have to select)
    - Select "Preemption Model (Preemptible kernel (Low-Latency Desktop))"
    - Disable “Use register arguments” - this option does not exist for newer kernels (version > 2.6.19)
    - Select "Interrupt pipeline"
    - Set "Timer frequency" to 1000 Hz
  - Power management and ACPI options:
    - Disable "Suspend to RAM and standby"
    - Disable "Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk')"
    - Disable "Run-time PM core functionality"
    - Disable "ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support"
    - Disable "CPU Frequency scaling"
    - Disable "CPU idle PM support"
    .
  - Device Drivers:
    - Enable "Staging drivers"
      - Select "Data acquisition support (comedi)"
        and all the comedi modules you need (or simply all of them)
    .
  .
Leave the configuration dialog by pressing "Exit" until you are asked "Save kernel config?".
Select "Yes".
-# Then compile and install the kernel
\code
make -j$(grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l) && make modules && make modules_install && make install
\endcode
This takes quite a while.
-# If necessary, install third party kernel modules as well,
like for example the ones for your graphics board.
(The following is probably outdated) For your nvidia graphics board, download the driver from
http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us.
Install it by calling
\code
$ sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-190.42-pkg2.run -k 3.8.13-rtai -K
\endcode
(replace 3.8.13-rtai by the name of the kernel where you want to install the nvidia driver,
i.e. the string '\c uname \c -r' would return if that kernel is running).
-# Finally you might need to create a RAM disk image file,
if \c make \c install did not create a \c /boot/initrd-3.8.13-rtai file already:
\code
$ cd /boot
$ update-initramfs -c -k 3.8.13-rtai
\endcode
-# On a Debian system there is an alternative to steps 5. - 8. for compiling a linux kernel. 
   You get a nice \c .deb fil ewith the compiled kernel, that you can install also on other machines.
   See http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Debian_Lenny_Compile_RTAI for more details.
   Do as root:
   -# Get the kernel-package
   \code
apt-get -y install kernel-package
   \endcode
   -# Configure and build the kernel:
   \code
export CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=$(grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l) # the number of CPU cores you have
make-kpkg clean
make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version -rtai --revision 1.0 --config menuconfig kernel-image # kernel-headers kernel-source
   \endcode
   See step 5. for the necessary kernel configurations.
   -# Install the kernel
   \code
cd ..
dpkg -i linux-image-3.8.13-rtai_1.0_amd64.deb # linux-headers-3.8.13-rtai_1.0_amd64.deb
   \endcode
   -# continue with step 10 (if you need to modify your grub configuration) or step 11.
-# Update your boot loader:
\code
update-grub
\endcode
    The output of \c update-grub should mention your new kernel image.
    You can configure \c grub \c v2 by editing the file \c /etc/default/grub .
    To get the boot menu that you need to select the kernel you want to boot
    you should for example unset the \c GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT and set the
    \c GRUB_TIMEOUT appropriately in that file. For example:
    \code
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true
GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
\endcode
    Also, if you do not like that grub puts your rtai kernel into a subsection called
    'Previous linux versions', then comment out the following lines in \c /etc/grub.d/10_linux
    \code
#  if [ "$list" ] && ! $in_submenu; then
#    echo "submenu \"Previous Linux versions\" {"
#    in_submenu=:
#  fi
\endcode
    After editing run \c update-grub to apply the changes.
-# Reboot the computer into the new kernel:
\code
reboot
\endcode
If this fails:
Try adding one or several of the advanced configuration and power interface (ACPI) or 
advanced programmable interrupt controller (APIC) options,
\c acpi=off \c pci=noacpi \c noapic \c nolapic \c lapic ,
to the kernel parameter in the \c kernel line of the
\c grub menu in \c /boot/grub/menu.lst (\c grub \c v1) or to the \c GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX variable
in \c /etc/defaults/grub . 
After restart, check for the number of CPUs in \c /proc/cpuinfo - they might be reduced by these parameters!


\section installnewlib Install the newlib library

For dynamic clamp having math functions available in the kernel is quite handy. For this RTAI needs
on a 64-bit system the math library from the newlib library as a replacement for the standrad \c libm.a .
As root:
\code
cd /usr/local/src
mkdir newlib
cd newlib
cvs -z 9 -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.org:/cvs/src login  # password: anoncvs
cvs -z 9 -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.org:/cvs/src co newlib
mkdir install
cd src/newlib
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/src/newlib/install --disable-shared CFLAGS="-O2 -mcmodel=kernel"
make
make install
\endcode


\section rtaiinstall RTAI kernel modules

-# Make sure that you are root and you are really running your RTAI kernel!
   You can check with
\code
uname -r
\endcode
-# Change to the RTAI directory
\code
cd /usr/local/src/rtai
\endcode
-# In case you downloaded RTAI from https://github.com/ShabbyX/RTAI,
you need to generate the configure script and makefiles first:
\code
./autogen.sh
\endcode
(do not call ./autogen.sh when using the original RTAI sources since it might fail).
-# Configure RTAI by calling
\code
make menuconfig
\endcode
Check the following settings:
 - General
   - Installation directory: should be set to \c /usr/realtime
   - Linux source tree: must be set to \c /usr/src/linux
   - RTAI Documentation: deselect all documentation (if you don't you might get an error)
   - Build RTAI testsuite: select
 - Machine
    - Enable FPU support: select
    - Number of CPUs: set to the right value.
      If in doubt, look into the file \c /proc/cpuinfo or run
      \code
grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l
\endcode
    .
 - Base system
   - Other features
     - Mathfuns support in kernel: select
     - 1 - NEWLIB (default), 2 - UCLIB, 3 - GLIBC: set to (1)
     - The installation directory of your chosen libm.a: set to "/usr/local/src/newlib/install/lib"
     .
   .
 - Add-ons
   - Real Time COMEDI support in user space: leave unselected
 .
Then exit and save configuration.
Watch the output while RTAI is configured for possible warnings and errors.
In case this fails, you should check and/or edit the file \c .rtai_config
and run \c .configure manually.
-# Compile and install
\code
make && make install
\endcode
Known issues:
  - In case you get an error like "/usr/include/features.h:323:26: fatal error: bits/predefs.h: No such file or directory" install the gcc-multilib package
  \code
apt-get install gcc-multilib
\endcode
  - In case you get an error like "../../../base/include/asm/rtai_leds.h:24:20: error: asm/io.h: No such file or directory"
  then delete the "#include <asm/io.h>" line in the specified file and call \c make again.
  - If you get error messages like 
    "../../../base/sched/liblxrt/.libs/liblxrt.so: undefined reference to `pthread_create'",
    i.e. undefined references to various pthread functions,
    then open \c base/sched/liblxrt/GNUmakefile in you favourite editor,
    find the line containing 'liblxrt_la_LIBADD' and add "-lpthread" to it so that this line looks like
    \code
liblxrt_la_LIBADD = -lpthread
\endcode
    Then
    \code
cd base/sched/liblxrt
make clean
cd -
make
\endcode
  .
-# Test RTAI by loading some modules:
\code
cd /usr/realtime/modules
insmod rtai_hal.ko
insmod rtai_sched.ko
insmod rtai_fifos.ko
insmod rtai_math.ko
\endcode
If this fails:
Try adding one or several of the advanced configuration and power interface (ACPI) or 
advanced programmable interrupt controller (APIC) options,
\c acpi=off \c pci=noacpi \c noapic \c nolapic \c lapic ,
to the kernel parameter in the \c kernel line of the
\c grub menu in \c /boot/grub/menu.lst (\c grub \c v1) or to the \c GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX variable
in \c /etc/defaults/grub . 
Recompile and install RTAI (make clean && make && make install && depmod -a).
After restart, check for the number of CPUs in \c /proc/cpuinfo - they might be reduced by these parameters!
-# If you have a multi-core system you should reserve at least one CPU for RTAI. You can isolate CPUs by using    the kernel parameter
   \code
isolcpus=0,1,2
   \endcode
  (for isolating the cores no. 0, 1, and 2) and by loading the rtai_hal kernel module the following way:
  \code
insmod rtai_hal.ko IsolCpusMask=0x07
  \endcode
  See the file \c /usr/local/src/rtai/README.ISOLCPUS for more details.
-# Run the RTAI latency test
\code
cd /usr/realtime/testsuite/kern/latency
./run
\endcode
Maybe this link is helpful to find good motherboards: http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Latency-Test 
(I am, however, not sure how this relates to RTAI).


\section installcomedi Comedi

The comedi kernel modules are already part of the kernel. You only need to install the comedi library:
\code
sudo apt-get install libcomedi-dev
\endcode

You should install the \c comedi drivers and library prior to
configuring RELACS, so that ./configure can detect the presence of the
\c comedi library. If you install \c comedi later, simply run \c
./configure and \c make again to detect comedi and compile the
corresponding plugins for RELACS.


\section installcomediold Install comedi from scratch

For an RTAI kernel you definitely have to install the Comedi drivers 
yourself according to the following instructions:

-# Follow the instructions above for installing 
\ref installcomedidriver .
For configuring \c Comedi you should use
\code
$ ./configure --with-linuxdir=/usr/src/linux --with-rtaidir=/usr/realtime
\endcode
-# Check loading the \c Comedi module:
\code
$ modprobe comedi
\endcode
On failure, call 
\code
$ dmesg
\endcode
to get more details. If it says "unknown symbol", then you might have forgotten
to deselect the "Module versioning support" in the "loadable module support"
section of the kernel configuration. Either recompile your kernel with the 
"Module versioning support" deselected, or
\code
$ cp /lib/modules/`uname -r`/rtai/Module.symvers /usr/local/src/comedi/comedi
$ make clean
$ make && make install
$ depmod -a
$ cp /usr/local/src/comedi/comedi/Module.symvers /lib/modules/`uname -r`/comedi
\endcode
-# Then follow the instructions above for installing (if not already done, this is independent of the kernel used)
  - \ref installcomedilib
  - \ref installcomedicalib


\section testrelacs Test RELACS
-# Configure and compile RELACS. cd into the root directory of the relacs source tree, then:
\code
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make -j$(grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
\endcode
-# Load the dynamic clamp kernel module (as root):
\code
cd plugins/linuxdevices/rtaicomedi/module
./loadmodules.sh
\endcode
-# Run RELACS
\code
$ cd - # cd back into the top-level directory of RELACS
$ cd plugins/patchclamp
$ cp relacs.cfg.dynclamp relacs.cfg
$ ./relacslocal
\endcode
-# Possible problems are:
  - Data acquisition does not start:
    - You might not have 
      sufficient permissions for reading and writing to the 
      \c /dev/comedi* devices. For a quick fix do
      as root
      \code
$ chmod a+rw /dev/comedi*
      \endcode
      See \ref udev below for a better solution.
    - The %comedi and rtai modules are not properly loaded.
    - The %comedi device is not configured yet.
    .
  - Performance is bad / RELACS regularly hangs for a few seconds / RELACS seems to be slowed down dramatically.
    - Disable APM and ACPI by adding \c "apm=off" and \c acpi=off to the kernel parameter in the \c kernel line of the
      \c grub menu in \c /boot/grub/menu.lst .
    .
  .

\section udev Setting up udev permissions for Comedi device files

Once comedi is installed you also need to make sure that you (the
user) have appropriate permissions for accessing the comedi device
files. That is you need to be able to have read and write access to
the \c /dev/comedi* files. One elegant way to achieve this to create a
new group and tell udev to add the comedi device files to this group.

-# Login as root.
-# Create a new group "iocard":
\code
addgroup --system iocard
\endcode
-# Add udev rules to the /etc/udev/rules.d directory:
\code
echo 'KERNEL=="comedi*", MODE="0660", GROUP="iocard"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/95-comedi.rules
\endcode
-# Run
\code
udevadm trigger
\endcode
to apply your new udev rules
-# Add users to the "iocard" group:
\code
adduser \<username\> iocard
\endcode
After the next login, \c \<username\> is a member of the \c iocard group
and and has sufficient permissions to access the data acquisition boards through \c Comedi.


\section dynamicclamp Setting up dynamic clamp for RELACS
-# \c cd into the RELACS top-level directory and run
\code
$ ./configure
\endcode
This should detect RTAI (see message towards the end of the output of \c configure).
-# Then compile the dynamic clamp plugins and the kernel module:
\code
$ cd plugins/linuxdevices/comedi
$ make clean
$ make
\endcode
-# Load the dynamic-clamp kernel module (as root):
\code
$ cd plugins/linuxdevices/comedi/module
$ ./loadmodules.sh
\endcode
-# If you want to load the dynamic-clamp kernel module automatically during 
the boot process, then call the \c loadmodules.sh script from the script
\c /etc/rc.local . Simply add a line like this
\code
/where/ever/the/script/is/located/loadmodules.sh
\endcode
to \c /etc/rc.local.

\section kernelmessages Kernel messages
When fiddling around with kernel modules you might want to have a look 
at the kernel messages in \c /var/log/messages:
\code
$ tail -f /var/log/messages
\endcode
alternatively use
\code
$ less /var/log/messages
\endcode
and hit 'F'. Both commands will then show what was added 
to the messages immediately. Interrupt this by hitting \c ctrl-c.

In case you do not have a \c /var/log/messages file
(unfortunately the default in modern ubuntu based systems),
you have to enable it. As root open the file \c /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
in an editor. Remove the hash marks in front of the following lines:
\code
*.=info;*.=notice;*.=warn;\\
        auth,authpriv.none;\\
        cron,daemon.none;\\
        mail,news.none          -/var/log/messages
\endcode
The tell the system that you changed this file (still as root):
\code
restart rsyslog 
\endcode

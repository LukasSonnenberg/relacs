\mainpage DAQFlex Plugins

\brief Data acquisition devices of Measurement Computing's DAQFlex series.

\section install Installation requirements for DAQFlex

You only need to install the libusb-1.0 development package:
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
\endcode
Then run \c ./configure and \c make to compile the DAFlex plugins.

`make install`  copies the firmware files from `firmware/`  to
`<prefix>/lib/daqflex/` .

\note The firmware files are kindly provided by Measurement Computing Corporation.
You may check their website <http://www.mccdaq.com/> for more recent updates.


\section udev Setting up udev permissions for DAQFlex USB devices

You need to make sure that you (the user) have appropriate permissions
for accessing the DAQFlex USB devices. One elegant way to achieve this
to create a new group and tell udev to add the comedi device files to
this group.
 
-# Login as root.
-# Create a new group "iocard":
\code
$ addgroup --system iocard
\endcode
-# Add udev rules. On new (after mid 2012) Linux systems create the file
`/lib/udev/rules.d/98-daqflex.rules`
 and paste the following lines into that file:
\include 98-daqflex-new.rules
On older system (prior to mid 2012) create the file
`/etc/udev/rules.d/98-daqflex.rules` and paste the following lines into that file:
\include 98-daqflex-old.rules
Both files are also installed to `<prefix>/lib/daqflex/` . So you can simply copy them to the
right directory. New system:
\code
$ cp /usr/lib/daqflex/98-daqflex-new.rules /lib/udev/rules.d/
\endcode Old system:
\code
$ cp /usr/lib/daqflex/98-daqflex-old.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
\endcode
(replace `/usr` by whatever path you specified as the prefix for `./configure`).
-# Run
\code
$ udevadm trigger
\endcode
to apply your new udev rules
-# Add users to the "iocard" group:
\code
$ adduser <username> iocard
\endcode
After the next login, `<username>` is a member of the `iocard` group
and and has sufficient permissions to access the DAQFlex data acquisition boards.

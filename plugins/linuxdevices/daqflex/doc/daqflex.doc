\mainpage DAQFlex Plugins

\brief Data acquisition devices of Measurement Computing's DAQFlex series.

\section install Installation requirements for DAQFlex

You only need to install the libusb-1.0 development package:
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
\endcode
Then run \c ./configure and \c make to compile the DAQFlex plugins.

\c make \c install  copies the firmware files from \c firmware/  to
\c \<prefix\>/lib/daqflex/ .

\note The firmware files are kindly provided by Measurement Computing Corporation.
You may check their website <http://www.mccdaq.com/> for more recent updates.


\section udev Setting up udev permissions for DAQFlex USB devices

You need to make sure that you (the user) have appropriate permissions
for accessing the DAQFlex USB devices. One elegant way to achieve this
is to create a new group and tell udev to add the usb device files with
a DAQFlex device to this group.
 
-# Create a new group "iocard":
\code
sudo addgroup --system iocard
\endcode
-# Add udev rules. On new (after mid 2012) Linux systems create the file
\c /lib/udev/rules.d/98-daqflex.rules (as root)
 and paste the following lines into that file:
\include 98-daqflex.rules
On older system (prior to mid 2012) create the file
\c /etc/udev/rules.d/98-daqflex.rules and paste the following lines into that file:
\include 98-daqflex-old.rules
Both files are also installed to \c \<prefix\>/lib/daqflex/ . So you can simply copy them to the
right directory. New system:
\code
sudo cp /usr/lib/daqflex/98-daqflex.rules /lib/udev/rules.d/
\endcode Old system:
\code
sudo cp /usr/lib/daqflex/98-daqflex-old.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
\endcode
(replace \c /usr by whatever path you specified as the prefix for \c ./configure, \c /usr is the default).
-# Run
\code
sudo udevadm trigger
\endcode
to apply your new udev rules
-# Add users to the "iocard" group:
\code
sudo adduser \<username\> iocard
\endcode
After the next login, \c \<username\> is a member of the \c iocard group
and and has sufficient permissions to access the DAQFlex data acquisition boards.


\section test Testing acquisition

Depending on your system the maximum possible sampling rates for
analog input and output might be lower than the ones the data
acquisition boards suppports. This happens in particular with
simultaneous analog input and output. In case you get error messages
(also on console) about overflows and underruns you need to reduce the
sampling rates.

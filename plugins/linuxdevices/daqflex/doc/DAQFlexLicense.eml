Dear Jan,

Thank you for your email.

Yes you can distribute the *.rbf firmware files along with your program
sourcecode.

Yes it is sufficient to mention Measurement Computing in the
documentation of the DAQFlex plugin.


Sincerely,

Brent

Problem Description:
Dear Madams and Sirs,

I have a question regarding the license of the firmware files that are
shipped with the DAQFlex tar archive.

I develop a software for electrophysiological experiments
(www.relacs.net). This software is licensed under the GNU GPL and the
source code is available at sourceforge.net. I provide support also for
your nice DAQFlex interface. The DAQFlex boards are accessed directly
via libusb-1.0 without using your mono based API. That is, somebody who
wants to use my RELACS software does not need to install the DAQFlex API
and software. The only files I rely on are the firmware files (*.rbf).

Can I distribute the *.rbf files along with the sourcecode of my
software? Since the DAQFlex part is only a plugin to my software, would
it be sufficient to mention MCC in the documentation of the DAQFlex
plugin? Or how do you want me to document the origin and copyright on
the rbf files?

Best regards,
Jan Benda

== Next ==
- OS dependent make rules (for hardware plugins)? (QUICK)


== Optional ==
- Integrate examples (with extra target)  no-compile Makefiles???
- Integrate librand55
    http://summa.physik.hu-berlin.de/~beule/random/random55.tar.gz


== Notes ==
- Log files written to relacs exec dir, not /var/log? 
  - Set log location in <relacslocal>/<src/relacs>
    use @...@ for this (prefix?)
- Reading config from PWD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH containing PWD
  - On/off by user?
- Doxygen currently does not create anything useful for auditory and
  common folder. Any ideas?

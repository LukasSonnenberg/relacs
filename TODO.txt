== Next ==
- Add configure scripts to all seven libraries if possible (LATER)
  - Extract GSL detection
    - Make macro from that
- Doxygen stuff
    - auditory/doc/auditory.dox
    - common/doc/common.dox
    - patch/doc/patch.dox

from auditory/Makefile:
# Create plugin documentation:
doc:
        sed "s-^INPUT.*-INPUT = $(SUBDIRS)-;" doc/auditory.dox > tmp.dox
        doxygen tmp.dox
        rm -f tmp.dox

# Create RePro help files:
help: doc
        mkdir -p help
        $(TOPDIR)/utils/createhelp help


- resolve moc rules in plugins (e.g. common/) and once as an example in a library (e.g. widgets/)

- an example standalone plugin (patchclamp) with tests for the libraries

- OS dependent make rules (for hardware plugins)? (QUICK)

- hardware: find -lcomedi (www.comedi.org).


== Optional ==
- Integrate examples (with extra target)  no-compile Makefiles???
- Integrate librand55
    http://summa.physik.hu-berlin.de/~beule/random/random55.tar.gz
- Extra summary for configure at the very end


== Notes ==
- Log files written to relacs exec dir, not /var/log? 
  - Set log location in <relacslocal>/<src/relacs>
    use @...@ for this (prefix?)
- Reading config from PWD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH containing PWD
  - On/off by user?

\page stimulusmetadata Metadata description of stimuli

Stimuli are assembled from basic components like sine-waves, pulses,
etc.  Each stimulus component is described by a odML section.  The
type of the section defines which type of stimulus component was used.
The properties of the section describe timing and amplitude
information and further specific parameter of the stimulus component.

A stimulus component can also get a usefull name in addition to its
type.  This name can be used to mark functional aspects of the
stimulus components.  For example, "prepulse" and "testpulse" can be
used to differeniate between succeeding pulse stimuli. THe names
should be unique in its level of the hierarchy.


\section general General properties

- Modality: what kind of physical stimulus is it, sound, light etc.
  \todo We need to define useful keywords!
- OutputChannel: what exactly should this denote?


\section timing Timing properties

- StartTime: the start of the stimulus component relative to the 
  temporaloffset of the parent node.
- Duration: the duration of the stimulus component.


\section amplitude Amplitude properties
- Intensity:
- Meanintensity:
- Standarddeviation:
- Amplitude:
- How to incorporate attenuator settings?
- There could be a general problem: the stimulus put out is not exactly the stimulus that is delivered.
  E.g. sound pressure level versus sound intensity, EFish AM, direct versus resulting AM.


\section assemble Assemble a complex stimulus from components

- appending stimuli
- adding stimuli
- multiplying stimuli (amplitude modulations):
  - Function: Carrier/AM

\section ambiguities Ambiguities
and rules how to avoid them

- sineWave() can be stimulus or carrier with const AM. How to deal with that?
  Even worse: what is that two-frequency stimulus in isoresponse?
- morphing stimuli from pulses to sine waves
- pulses with ramps look like triangles


\section sequences Sequences of stimuli
for example, how o define a series of pulses with growing amplitudes
- InterstimulusInterval
- Repetitions
- etc.
